# TED-SQL-Analysis
This project is a SQL analysis of the data that was scraped from TED website. 
Skills like CTEs and Window Functions are used in this analysis to derive insights such as the most viewed talks, 
comparison between the first ever talks and the latest talks, the most represented occupations, the busiest time of the year for TED among other insights.
